Hello,
This is Snehal.
Here is a code for application of ordering pizza online. I have used HTML5, Javascript, JQuery, CSS, Ajax, Lightbox, PHP for this. 

Step-1. Upload code on your server or install XAMPP server or any app like XAMPP on your local machine and copy the code in XAMPP's htdocs folder.
Step-2. Open home.html with your server's URL in a browser if code uploaded on a server. If XAMPP installed, first open XAMPP Control panel and click on 'Start' and then type 'localhost/home.html' in browser URL to run tha application.

Note: Since Javascript or Jquery is client side scripting language, PHP is used for writing into JSON file. You will need to upload the code on server or you can run it on your localhost after installing xampp server or another app which will run PHP code.
